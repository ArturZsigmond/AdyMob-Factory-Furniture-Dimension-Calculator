# AdyMob-Factory-Furniture-Dimension-Calculator
This project is developed for AdyMob Factory to assist in calculating the dimensions of each side of furniture pieces, such as cabinets, based on user inputs. The software is designed to streamline the process of determining accurate cut sizes for each side of the furniture, considering material thickness and placement options.

Features:

- Unit Selection: Users can choose their preferred unit of measurement (mm, cm, m).
- Dimension Input: Users can input the height, length, and width of the furniture.
- Material Thickness Input: Allows specification of material thickness for each part (top, bottom, front, back, left, and right) or a single thickness for all parts.
- Placement Options: Users can specify whether the top and bottom parts go between or over the sides.
- Front and Back Thickness: Separate input for front and back material thickness to adjust the overall dimensions.
- Calculation of Dimensions: Calculates and outputs the dimensions for each side to cut.
- Material Area Calculation: Computes the total area of material required in square meters.

Future Goals:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a user-friendly GUI to enhance user experience.
- Save to Excel: Implement functionality to save the calculated dimensions and material requirements to an Excel file.
- Material Optimization: Add features for optimizing material usage to reduce waste.
- 3D Visualization: Integrate a 3D visualization tool to preview the assembled furniture.
- Database Integration: Store and retrieve user inputs and calculation results from a database.
- Multiple Language Support: Expand the language options beyond Romanian.

Many thanks for the help of my fellow Alexandra with this project!
